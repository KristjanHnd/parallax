                <h3>A Leader in new technology </h3>
                <p>
                    Transport is experiencing one of the biggest shifts in its history. Our business landscape is more disruptive than ever, with new technologies and business models emerging all the time. At Scania we’re responding to these changes by developing a clear roadmap for the future that strikes the right balance between today’s and tomorrow’s business needs. This involves investing significantly in technology for sustainable transport solutions that are viable today, while also developing the autonomous, electrified and connected transport technologies of tomorrow.
By using our modular approach and working with a wide range of technology partners, we’re able to innovate rapidly, bringing tomorrow’s automated, electrified and connected transport solutions to today's transport. Our pilots – such as our e-highway trials in Germany, Sweden and Italy, and our autonomous concept vehicles – are crucial building blocks, enabling us to explore possibilities, develop our capabilities and demonstrate the potential of new technologies to our customers and partners.

                <h3>Gustaf Erikson is the father of the Swedish car industry.  </h3>
                <p>
                    Volvo and Saab are not the only Swedish cars that have rolled on swedish roads. As early as 1897, Gustaf Erikson designed Sweden’s first car with an internal combustion engine. Since then, at least 150 different car models have rolled out from Swedish garages, bicycle workshops, factories and industries.
